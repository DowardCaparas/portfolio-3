              It was a moment of celebration, relief, and pride. As the
              programmer of the team, I remembered all the late nights spent
              figuring out how to build the system.

              We created the game using <strong>Unity3D</strong> and{" "}
              <strong>C#</strong>. It&apos;s a 2D educational game designed to make
              learning about space fun and engaging for kids. The game teaches
              about <em>planets</em>, <em>constellations</em>, <em>galaxies</em>
              , and unique materials found on other worlds. It features three
              mini-games: <strong>Planet Adventure</strong>,
              <strong> Word Puzzle</strong>, and <strong>Sliding Puzzle</strong>
              .

              None of it would&apos;ve been possible without God&apos;s guidance
